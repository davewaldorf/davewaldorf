Full-Stack Software Engineer with 4+ years of experience turning ideas into reality using React ⚛️, TypeScript 🔧, Node.js 🌐, and Next.js. With over a decade of experience in fashion, art, and photography 🎨, I’ve developed a unique ability to approach problems creatively and deliver solutions with precision.

I build high-impact applications, like a mobile platform connecting job seekers to opportunities 💼 and MVPs for decentralized apps. I focus on clean, scalable architecture and performance optimization.

Passionate about blending creativity with technical skills, I aim to create innovative solutions that engage users and drive business growth.

In my free time, you’ll find me immersed in art, music, and fashion, or balancing my life with yoga 🧘‍♂️, gym workouts 🏋️‍♂️, and outdoor adventures like hiking 🥾 and cycling 🚴‍♂️. I also enjoy reading 📚, nurturing my collection of plants 🌱, and spending quality time with my cat 🐱.
